Project Setup & Intro to the Toolchain
--------------------------------------

### Preparation

* Print out Open Drupal VM passwords

### What we'll cover today:

* Deciding on a project to work on over the coming workshops, so there is a consistent focus and so you can build something useful and use as evidence.
* Setting up and making sure we're comfortable with our local development environments, so when we use this environments in the future we know what we're doing.
* Using the command line & Drush, as they are widely used developer tools and can make you quicker and access more powerful system features.

### 1. Decide on a project

Intro (1 - 2 hours)

Think about a project you're interested in creating, you'll be working on this for the next year! Look through the [project examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BzS3s9jPn08-V3NkQ0Z1RzNaMU0/0ByiysEQCBIteU3Q4eU1JT01PcEU/0By9KqisVw_3lTnRSZnVPb2RIMjA) and use these as suggestions for the types of project you could create.

Your project must include the following:

* It should be focused around content you'll add yourself, and have a section listing this content in some way.
* It should accept and process user input in some way.
* It should be something realistic and suitable for Drupal.
* Any advanced functionality should be documented in a separate part of your plan.
* The project must be started from scratch, so no distributions or existing websites you've built.

Now, do the following:

* __Do:__ Write up your project plan and include: a summary of the site, the main pages, key Drupal modules, advanced functionality.
* __Group discussion:__ on each project individually.
* __Checkpoint:__ rename your Google Doc to "Full Project Plan" and save it in a folder called "Open Drupal - [name]" replacing [name] with your full name. Now share this folder with the trainer.

### 2. Setup our local development environments

(1 hour)

* __Do:__ Open Drupal VM tutorial, *Tutorials->open_drupal_vm.md*
* Now set up a snapshot at your machine's vanilla state.
* __Checkpoint:__ all have a working local environment and be able to edit our Drupal sites.
* __Group discussion:__ Q&A on virtual machines and local setup, tips & tricks on local development.

### 3. Toolchain: command line

(1 - 2 hours)

* __Group discussion:__ the command line, what is it? Why should we use it (it's quicker and more powerful)?
* Run through *Toolchain->01_command_line.md*
* __Quiz:__ common terminal commands (see http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html#linux-mac-osx)

### 4. Drush

(1 - 2 hours)

* Run through *Toolchain->02_drush.md*
